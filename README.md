Proyecto MVC - PHP8 - MySQL - CSS - SASS

//DESCRIPTION: <br>
Hello! This is a project created mostly in PHP, CSS(Using SASS) & JS. It is a business website dedicated to the sale and purchase of homes. 
We have an administrator panel that allows us to add new homes, new sellers and new blog entries. Also with a form that will allow you to contact the administrator of the website.

//HOW MAKE IT WORKS <br>
I have left you the databases that I have used as a sample in the "db_export" folder. Import them on your pc, and launch the web with the server you use. (I have been using php server).
So you can see all the dynamic data on the web.


To access the administrator panel you can use:

User: admin <br>
Password: 123456

From there you can make any changes to the data shown on the web. I aprreciate any suggestion or improvement in the code, thanks for your time ^-^/
